Star Rating
Design and implement a "Star Rating" component using React.

Requirements:
- Ensure the component is fully functional and displays a visual representation of a star rating system, with 5 stars that users can click to set a rating.
- Enhance the component to be more user-friendly and visually appealing. This can involve adding the hover effect, or changing the star icons' appearance when active/hovered.
- Write the component in a way that it can easily be reused across different parts of an application and can accept different sizes, current rating, etc for the stars as props.
