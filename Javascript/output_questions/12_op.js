const str = "abc" + + "def";
console.log(str); // abcNaN
//Explanation: The expression "abc" + + "def" is evaluated as "abc" + (+"def"). 
// The unary plus operator (+) is used to convert the string "def" to a number.
// The string "def" cannot be converted to a number, so the result is NaN (Not a Number).       
// So, the output is "abc" + NaN = "abcNaN".
// The output is "abcNaN".
