//1_HCL_ANS

//Explaination:
//The array arr is compared with the string a. 
//  The array arr is converted to a string which is "1,2". 
// So, the comparison is between "1,2" and "1,2". Both are equal. So, the output is true.
//====
//2
//1
//1
//0
//1
//Explanation:
//The logical OR operator (||) returns the first true operand. 
// If both operands are false, it returns the second operand.
//The logical AND operator (&&) returns the first false operand. 
// If both operands are true, it returns the second operand.
